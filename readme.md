This is the ReadMe file for my Recommendation Programm.

It's a "Portfolio Project" from the Codecademy Computer Science Course. This Project marks the end of the coding part, before the course continues with databases.

The programm is seperated into multiple components in the "components"-folder. It is done to keep the individual files and functions simple and clean. Addionally it provides the seperation of concerns.

The files include comments with explanations to make it more clear to the reader, how each function works.

1.1 main.py:
    main.py is the main file for the programm and consists of:
    - an import from the start() function, 
    - the main() function and
    - the __name__ variable that is set to "__main__"

The main() function welcomes the user by printing "Hello User!"

The __name__ variable includes and calls the previously mentioned main() function.
